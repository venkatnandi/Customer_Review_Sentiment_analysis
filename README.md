# Customer_Review_Sentiment_analysis
It's an ML model on Customer_Review_Sentimental_analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the sentiment of customer reviews of restaurants. The model was trained on a dataset of restaurant reviews labelled as positive, negative, or neutral. The model uses the following steps:

Import libraries
Read data
Text preprocessing (cleaning and compressing data)
Sentence tokenization
Text tokenization
Removal of punctuation, memorable characters, and converting text to lowercase
Removal of stop words
Lemmatization and stemming
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Encoding data (converting text data to numeric)
TF-IDF (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency)
Apply machine learning
Split the data as training set and test set
Scaling the data
Apply machine learning algorithms
Model evaluation
The model was evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set.

The model can be used to predict the sentiment of new customer reviews. This information can be used to improve the customer experience by identifying and addressing any potential problems.

The model was implemented in Python using the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
The repository also includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the steps of building and evaluating the model.
